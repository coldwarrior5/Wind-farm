# Wind-farm
Unity based application for simulating wind farm and its power output

This application simulates real world conditions on the Pometeno brdo hill where are situated 16 Konƒçar wind turbines. A lot of effort was put into the modelling of the wind turbine in order to accuratelly simulate real world conditions and forces.

This is not a finished product as of yet, but I will continue to work on this as a project for graduate programme.
